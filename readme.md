# Bucket List

Create an application to make a 'bucket list' of countries you want to visit:

- Use the rest countries API to get the countries of the world.
- Add countries to a bucket list.
- Persist this list using Mongo.
- Try to split your client code into models and views. Think about the responsibilities of each.
